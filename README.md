This repository contains a collection of machine learning case studies and projects developed as part of my learning and practice in artificial intelligence and data science. Each case study explores different datasets, techniques, and algorithms to understand how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems.

The work begins with introductory datasets and gradually moves towards more advanced applications. It covers exploratory data analysis, regression, classification, clustering, and basic computer vision tasks. Some of the datasets include the Boston Housing dataset for predicting house prices, the Voices dataset for gender recognition, the Loan dataset for approval prediction, and the Drivers dataset for clustering with KMeans. Other case studies focus on data preprocessing, feature encoding, and applying algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and linear regression.

The repository is implemented in Python, using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Jupyter Notebooks are used to structure the work, making it easier to understand the step-by-step approach taken in each case study.

To run the notebooks, clone this repository and open the required case study folder. The notebooks can be executed using Jupyter Notebook after installing the necessary dependencies.

This project highlights my practice and exploration in the field of machine learning. It demonstrates my ability to handle datasets, apply algorithms, perform feature engineering, and evaluate models. The repository is an ongoing effort and will be expanded with more case studies and improvements over time.
